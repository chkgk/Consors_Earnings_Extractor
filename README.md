# Earnings Extractor
This little python class extracts dividend and earnings data from "Dividendengutschrift" and "Ertragsgutschrift" PDFs. The class allows to back-translate asset identification numbers (WKN) into securities names and employs simple caching for both data extracted from files as well as looked-up names.
